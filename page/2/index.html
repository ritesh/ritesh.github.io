      I recently acquired a shiny new-ish desktop from a friend. Intel Core-i7 with 8 cores and a whopping 12 GB of RAM with a high-end ATI Radeon graphics card. It came with Windows 7 pre-installed and I decided to install Ubuntu 12.04 amd64 as a dual boot option. Initially, I had some trouble getting it to install on the inbuilt SSD (which should have been the first warning sign in retrospect).

      I&rsquo;ve had a Gmail account for the last few years and the number of emails I get every day varies between ten to thirty. Out of the emails I receive, there are probably five or six emails per week that require either my attention or a reply. The majority of these are spammy emails that come from Indian companies with dubious privacy policies. I remember unsubscribing from most of them but I still keep getting emails from them or their &lsquo;selected&rsquo; partners (Find your life partner!

      If you&rsquo;re anything like me, you might casually type rm -rf * in your home directory when you really meant to delete the contents of another directory. You should, of course, always have a backup of the contents of your home directory just in case this happens. There is simple hack to force rm to prompt you to think about the files that are going to be deleted. Create a file called &lsquo;-i&rsquo; in the directory whose contents you want to protect from accidental deletion.

      I sometimes forget this really easy one liner for doing things in a batch on Linux/MacOS. # for file in `find . -type f`; do somescript.py $file; done If you&rsquo;re relying on the output of find it is probably best to use the xargs option to find like so: # find . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 somescript.py Even better, you can avoid using xargs, instead use the exec option to find.

      After encountering an annoying bug on CyanogenMod, I decided to give MIUI another go. For some reason, my phone constantly vibrated in call, possibly due to an obscure proximity sensor setting. Having tried a number of ways to switch it off, I finally gave up and decided it was time to try something different. My SO got an iPhone 4s and I was very close to getting one for myself. I&rsquo;m usually reluctant to switch Android ROMs as I&rsquo;ve switched to using 2 factor authentication for my Google account and having to reset the authenticator etc is annoying.

      There are many ways to do this. You could use Windows Movie Maker, iMovie or professional movie editing applications. If you&rsquo;re looking for something quick and dirty from the command line, especially if you have all images in one directory and they don&rsquo;t require any post processing, ImageMagick can help. ImageMagick is available for for Windows, Linux and MacOS X. The convert utility that comes with it is probably one of the most useful utilities I&rsquo;ve ever used.

      I&rsquo;m a big fan of Python, especially its syntax which feels close to natural language. My programming skills are average, as I&rsquo;ve never done any serious full time development, apart from some code I wrote for my MSc project. The project was mostly built using scrapy with little hacks thrown in to implement concurrency for processing data. Nowadays, I tend to use Python mostly as a glue language to automate stuff when bash doesn&rsquo;t cut it.
