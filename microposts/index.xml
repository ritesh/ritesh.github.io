      <description>I have too many books to read, and too little time! I&amp;rsquo;m currently making my way through The Go Programming Language by Alan Donovan &amp;amp; the Brian Kernighan, slowly but steadily. I&amp;rsquo;d purchased the book a while ago, but have been reading it in bite sized chunks. I&amp;rsquo;m somewhat familiar with Go as it is fairly easy to learn and you don&amp;rsquo;t have to keep fighting the compiler but it gives you excellent compile time guarantees.</description>

      <description>Trying to build a Qt project on Linux today. Turns out, (some) Qt programmers are case insensitive when it comes to including heAdEr fiLEs in C++ source. This is fine on Windows and macOS, but on an OS with a case sensitive filesystem like ext4, this causes a whole lot of problems. gcc and g++ try and fail to find coolHeader.h if it&amp;rsquo;s called CoolHeader.h. I&amp;rsquo;m sure that this isn&amp;rsquo;t an uncommon problem, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find a solution that didn&amp;rsquo;t involve serious sed-fu.</description>
