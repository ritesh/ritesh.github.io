          <p>I have too many books to read, and too little time! I&rsquo;m currently making my way through [The Go Programming Language] (<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Programming-Language-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Computing-ebook/dp/B0184N7WWS/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1505071377&amp;sr=1-4">https://www.amazon.co.uk/Programming-Language-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Computing-ebook/dp/B0184N7WWS/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1505071377&amp;sr=1-4</a>) by Alan Donovan &amp; the Brian Kernighan, slowly but steadily. I&rsquo;d purchased the book a while ago, but have been reading it in bite sized chunks. I&rsquo;m somewhat familiar with Go as it is fairly easy to learn and you don&rsquo;t have to keep fighting the compiler but it gives you excellent compile time guarantees. This makes it an easy language to pick up for someone familiar with Python (and without a software development background).</p>
<p>There are some aspects of the language that I don&rsquo;t yet fully understand and I&rsquo;m always keen to improve. This book is an enjoyable introduction to the language and feels like an excellent text book on the subject - with exercises that I should probably do, at some point. I suspect that even seasoned programmers will get a lot of out it as it covers some interesting bugs from programs that are syntactically correct, but logically wrong. It is often easy to resort to stackoverflow or find a blog post about a particular issue when learning a new language and hitting a wall but it is easier to dive deep to get a better understanding, especially when you&rsquo;re learning a new language.</p>
