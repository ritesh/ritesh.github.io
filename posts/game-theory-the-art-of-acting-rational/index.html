<p>You are in a game show with nineteen other players. You don&rsquo;t know the other players, you can&rsquo;t see them, and you can&rsquo;t communicate with them. The game you are in is called &lsquo;<em>Greed!</em>', and is straightforward to explain. You are asked to write down a whole dollar amount in the range $1 - $1,000,000 on a piece of paper. You will be paid the amount you asked for if it is deemed to be &lsquo;non-greedy&rsquo;. Whether your request is indeed &lsquo;non-greedy&rsquo; will be decided once all twenty request have been received by the host of the show. Your requested amount will be labeled &lsquo;non-greedy&rsquo; if no other player has asked for less, and at least one player has asked for more.</p>
<p>How do you play?</p>
