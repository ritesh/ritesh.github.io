<p>I think it&rsquo;s high time they changed the course material for MCSE. A quick google search will show that the youngest was 10 years old (A Pakistani girl) and many more 10-15 year olds had probably had a go at it too.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the youngest person to crack the RHCE is 12 years old, which makes you think. Also the little boy in question did flunk the first time, which leads me to believe that RHCE is slightly more challenging.</p>
