<p>I was disappointed to see that there were no ready-made packages available for Fedora 9 so I decided to compile from source.

Be sure to read the <a href="http://www.truecrypt.org/docs/">TrueCrypt documentation </a></p>
<p>**Obligatory Warning: I do not claim that this is the best way to go about installing TrueCrypt on your system and I am not liable for any damages caused **</p>
<p>With that out of the way here is what you need:</p>
<ol start="0">
<li>
<p>Ensure that your box is up to date<br>
$ sudo yum -y update</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install fuse and development packages<br>
$ sudo yum install fuse fuse-devel</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install gtk2 development libraries<br>
$ sudo yum -y install gtk2-devel</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Obtain a copy of the wxWidgets source version 2.8 from SourceForge<br>
$ wget <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/wxwindows/wxWidgets-2.8.7.tar.gz">http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/wxwindows/wxWidgets-2.8.7.tar.gz</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Download the latest TrueCrypt source package from their <a href="http://www.truecrypt.org/downloads2.php">website </a>(As of writing this, it was version 6.0a)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Untar the wxWidgets source into a directory of your choice. I chose /usr/src<br>
$ tar xzvf wxWidgets-2.8.7.tar.gz -C /usr/src</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Untar the TrueCrypt package to the temporary directory<br>
$ tar xzvf TrueCrypt 6.0a Source.tar.gz -C /tmp</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Change to the truecrypt directory to build the application<br>
$ cd /tmp/truecrypt-6.0a-source/<br>
$ make WX_ROOT=/usr/src/wxWidgets-2.8.7 wxbuild ##change accordingly to point to the wxWidgets source<br>
$ make</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If all goes well, you should have a truecrypt binary in the Main folder in the truecrypt source folder (/tmp/truecrypt-6.0a-source/Main/truecrypt). Copy this to /usr/bin (As root of course)</p>
