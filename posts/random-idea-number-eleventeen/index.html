<p>On a tech forum I visit often, we were discussing the various ways to<br>
power down a computer when power goes out (apart from the boring way<br>
of making your UPS automatically doing it for you). Now that I think<br>
about it, I&rsquo;m really obsessed with shutting computers down. I had an<br>
idea long ago which was quite stupid but I&rsquo;m gonna note it down anyway<br>
so that I can laugh about it later. Also, I want to ensure that<br>
Shampoo doesn&rsquo;t patent it.</p>
<p>What if I could shut down my computer by making it listen to the<br>
annoying beeps that UPSes usually make? All the cheap ones don&rsquo;t have<br>
an option to turn that off, so I could probably use it as signal to<br>
power down. Considering that linux has finally implemented some sort<br>
of &ldquo;sound framework&rdquo; that doesn&rsquo;t (theoretically at least) lock sound<br>
devices when a process accesses it, it should be quite trivial to<br>
create a lightweight daemon that samples from the system microphone<br>
and checks for the annoying beep waveform. If it matches, kill the<br>
system.</p>
<p>Two or three questions come to mind. The &ldquo;Why do this?&rdquo; can be<br>
answered with &ldquo;whatevs, becoz i can&rdquo;. The other more pertinent<br>
questions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>How difficult would this be to pull off?</li>
