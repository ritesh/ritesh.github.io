<p>IS GEORGE W. BUSH stupid? It&rsquo;s a question that occupied a good many minds of all political persuasions during his turbulent eight-year presidency. The strict answer is no. Bush&rsquo;s IQ score is estimated to be above 120, which suggests an intelligence in the top 10 per cent of the population. But this, surely, does not tell the whole story. Even those sympathetic to the former president have acknowledged that as a thinker and decision-maker he is not all there. Even his loyal speechwriter David Frum called him glib, incurious and &ldquo;as a result ill-informed&rdquo;. The political pundit and former Republican congressman Joe Scarborough accused him of lacking intellectual depth, claiming that compared with other US presidents whose intellect had been questioned, Bush junior was &ldquo;in a league by himself&rdquo;. Bush himself has described his thinking style as &ldquo;not very analytical&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Interesting study that explores the possibility that having a high IQ doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean you&rsquo;re smart. I, for one, feel vindicated as my last IQ test results were comparable to that of a pumpkin.</p>
