<p>Was following news of the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/">Apple WWDC</a> quite closely even though I don&rsquo;t own any working apple products. The only apple product I have is a 5 year old broken iPod. The set prices seems quite reasonable. $199 for the 8G version and $299 for the 16G one. I&rsquo;m pretty sure there are some hidden costs, though. Engadget, Gizmodo and LifeHacker have plenty of coverage of the event.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve just realized how hard it is to write. With every passing sentence I feel a grammatical, logical or spelling error coming on. Hats off to people who churn out pages after pages of blogs everyday.</p>
