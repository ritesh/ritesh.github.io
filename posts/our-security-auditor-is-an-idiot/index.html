<p>A security auditor for our servers has demanded the following within two weeks:</p>
<ul>
<li>A list of current usernames and plain-text passwords for all user accounts on all servers</li>
<li>A list of all password changes for the past six months, again in plain-text</li>
<li>A list of &ldquo;every file added to the server from remote devices&rdquo; in the past six months</li>
<li>The public and private keys of any SSH keys</li>

<p>As far as I&rsquo;m aware, everything on that list is ether impossible or incredibly difficult to get, but if I don&rsquo;t provide this information we loose access to our payments platform, and any income we might have got while we move away. Any suggestions for how I can solve or fake this information?</p>
<p>The only way I can think to get all the plain text passwords, is to get everyone to reset their password and make a note of what they set it to. That doesn&rsquo;t solve the problem of the past six months of password changes, because I can&rsquo;t retroactively log that sort of stuff, the same goes for logging all the remote files.</p>
<p>Getting the public and private parts of the SSH keys is possible, but annoying as we have a few users with a few computers, all with their own SSH keys. Unless I&rsquo;ve missed an easier way to do that?</p>
<p>I have explained to him many times the things he&rsquo;s asking for are impossible, he responded in an email:</p>
<p>I have over 10 years experience in security auditing and a full<br>
understanding of the redhat security methods, so I suggest you check<br>
your facts about what is and isn&rsquo;t possible. You say no company could<br>
possibly have this information but I have performed hundreds of audits<br>
where this information has been readily available. All [generic credit<br>
card processing provider] clients are required to conform with our new<br>
security policies and this audit is intended to ensure those policies<br>
have been implemented* correctly.</p>

<p>What the what? This is probably the funniest thing I&rsquo;ve read in a while. How does this auditor still have a job?</p>
