          <p>I try and use my phone for everything I can. Some of the apps that I<br>
find very useful are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>fring (free): Works with gtalk, twitter, fb, msn etc. If you have<br>
one of those newfangled Nseries phones, you can use the front camera<br>
to make skype video calls (over WiFi).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nokia Messaging Email (free beta, might change in the future): The<br>
native email application on the E71 is a load of crap. It&rsquo;s amazing<br>
how they pitch it as a business phone and ship with a pathetic Email<br>
application. The Nokia Messaging application is pretty good, it has a<br>
very usable interface and supports HTML email. The only downside is<br>
that Nokia wants a copy of your email username and password.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mail for Exchange (free) : I don&rsquo;t actually use this for email,<br>
I&rsquo;ve set it to synchronize my contacts with Google Contacts. You can<br>
use this for push email if you need to use it with MS Exchange.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Splash ID (slightly expensive, USD 29) : I have this magical<br>
ability of forgetting passwords and PIN codes. This is the best<br>
application I&rsquo;ve found so far that does a good job of remembering them<br>
for me. The interface is slightly dated, but it works like a charm.<br>
Highly recommend it, as you should have different complex passwords<br>
for different services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Truphone (free app, pay for recharges): This is similar to the<br>
Gizmo application for making phone calls over WiFi. It is a lifesaver<br>
if you need to make a lot of international phone calls. It uses WiFi<br>
to connect and the call is carried out using VoIP. Pretty reasonable<br>
rates too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Putty for S60 (free, OSS): Most of you would never need/use this<br>
application. I use this to connect to my home computers to check on<br>
stuff. Also the ability to remotely reboot one&rsquo;s computer is awesome.</p>
</li>
</ol>
