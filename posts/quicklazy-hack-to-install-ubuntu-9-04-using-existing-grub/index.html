          <p>Prior to using any Debian derivatives, I was a RedHat fan and hence<br>
heavily favoured Fedora/CentOS/RHEL over other distributions. Over the<br>
last few releases Fedora has been a disappointment and I was stuck<br>
between using Gentoo/Ubuntu. Hell I even gave FreeBSD a shot (sucked<br>
for me). Gentoo was my favoured distribution about 2-3 years ago but<br>
the excessive kernel recompilation was really getting to me. To go the<br>
more <em>stable</em> path I decided to give Debian a shot. Debian lenny is an<br>
amazing release, except it sucked as a desktop OS for me. Random sound<br>
issues, flash taking the whole system down and poor 3D acceleration<br>
really ruined it for me (couldn&rsquo;t play quake live even with<br>
proprietary drivers).</p>
<p>I decided to finally switch to Ubuntu Jaunty (9.04). Being too lazy to<br>
connect an optical drive or buying blank CDs, I decided to install it<br>
using my existing GRUB setup (Debian). Turns out it&rsquo;s easier than<br>
Lindsay Lohan excessively inebriated.</p>
<p> A few preliminary notes: This has been tested using the Jaunty mini<br>
iso, not sure if other versions work as designed. Did not try<br>
installing using the wireless network (that would be stupid). Need a<br>
decent broadband connection (say 512kbps upward) for the installation<br>
to finish within a reasonable time (leave it overnight only after<br>
you&rsquo;re done selecting packages). Will hose your system if power goes<br>
out and you&rsquo;ve crossed the partitioning stage. Take like a backup,<br>
man.</p>
<p> Step 1: Get the mini.iso from here :<br>
<a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD</a><br>
Step 2: Extract the mini.iso to get two files, linux and initrd.gz<br>
Step 3: Rename those files for easy reference (eg linux_ubuntu &amp;<br>
initrd_ubuntu.gz)<br>
Step 4: Move them to your boot directory<br>
  #sudo mv linux_ubuntu initrd_ubuntu.gz /boot/<br>
Step 5: Edit /boot/grub/menu.lst using your favourite editor and add<br>
the lines to point to these</p>
<pre><code>  title		Ubuntu 9.04 installer   
  root (hd0,0)   
  kernel		/linux_ubuntu   
  initrd /initrd_ubuntu.gz
</code></pre><p> Remember the above setting should be <em>exactly</em> the same as the other<br>
lines on your existing linux install (If your current linux uses UUIDs<br>
then the root line would be replaced with a suitable UUID, the &ldquo;root&rdquo;<br>
parameter might work but I&rsquo;m not sure) except for the last two lines<br>
(kernel and initrd)</p>
<p> Step 6: Reboot select Ubuntu installer, proceed as usual, select your<br>
mirror, repartition your disks (even the partition you booted from can<br>
be destroyed; is that cool or what?) and let the installer do its<br>
thing.</p>
<p> I live in an area where powercuts are fairly common (even after a<br>
lying politician promised there would be no more), so i went with the<br>
minimal install during the initial setup (so that I&rsquo;d have something<br>
to fall back on as soon as possible) . After this I was able to reboot<br>
to a desktop-less OS. Doing an <code>sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop</code><br>
got the latest version of GNOME and associated stuff fresh from the<br>
repositories. Jaunty works great for me, even though I&rsquo;m afflicted<br>
with an ATI card (on board) and a faulty USB controller (disabled,<br>
using a PCI addon USB card instead).</p>
<p>Time taken to do the initial install: Approx an hour (including download time)<br>
Time taken to download the ubuntu-desktop packages: About 1 hr 30 minutes<br>
Time taken to install/configure the desktop package: About 15 minutes</p>
<p> My broadband connection is allegedly 1Mbps (ADSL) but it usually hangs<br>
somewhere between 512 and 768 and peaks at 1Mbps sometimes.</p>
<p> Hope this helps someone.</p>
