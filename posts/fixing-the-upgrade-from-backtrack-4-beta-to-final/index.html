          <p>Backtrack 4 was released today. I had just completed downloading the<br>
beta version only yesterday and finished installing it today. Since<br>
BT4 has now moved to Ubuntu, I&rsquo;d assumed that upgrading it to the<br>
final would be easy as apt-get pie. I did and pretty much hosed KDE. A<br>
little research showed that KDE is now in a different path (<code>/opt/kde3</code>)<br>
than it was before (<code>/usr/kde3</code>).</p>
<p>The quickest hack to fix this is to add <code>/usr/kde3</code> to the <code>PATH</code> line in<br>
your <code>.bashrc</code> . This still doesn&rsquo;t start KDE when you type startx<br>
however. I resorted to another (sigh) hack to make this run as I badly<br>
needed BT4 for work. echo &ldquo;<code>exec startkde</code>&rdquo; &gt; <code>~/.xinitrc</code> fixes that<br>
issue.<br>
This is cheap hackery. I&rsquo;m sure there are better ways to fix this.</p>
