      <description>All I want is for my podcasts to automatically sync with my ancient
iPod. So far, not one media player on Ubuntu Karmic can accomplish
this. Tried Rhythmbox, banshee, Amarok. FFFFFFUUUUUUUUUU!!!!</description>

      <description>Prior to using any Debian derivatives, I was a RedHat fan and hence
heavily favoured Fedora/CentOS/RHEL over other distributions. Over the
last few releases Fedora has been a disappointment and I was stuck
between using Gentoo/Ubuntu. Hell I even gave FreeBSD a shot (sucked
for me). Gentoo was my favoured distribution about 2-3 years ago but
the excessive kernel recompilation was really getting to me. To go the
more stable path I decided to give Debian a shot.</description>
