      <description>Received an email today about a job opening at a major CMM level
something company. Required skill : VMWare. Experience required 2 - 15
years. VMWare was founded in 1998, that gives us 12 years since it&amp;rsquo;s
been around. How does one have 15 years of experience with something
that wasn&amp;rsquo;t around until 12 years ago? Who writes these job
descriptions?</description>
