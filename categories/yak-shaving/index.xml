      <description>I had been running this blog using Jekyll for a while now, but didn&amp;rsquo;t quite understand how it all worked. Jekyll is a great tool, and you don&amp;rsquo;t need a whole lot of configuration to get started. If you&amp;rsquo;re using github to host either personal, project or organisation pages, Jekyll is a no-brainer to get started. However, as I&amp;rsquo;m not much of a Ruby programmer, I didn&amp;rsquo;t quite understand how Jekyll worked and having to gem install ruby felt wrong &amp;ndash; especially since it also installs a whole lot of other dependencies that I don&amp;rsquo;t understand, either.</description>
