      <description>After encountering an annoying bug on CyanogenMod, I decided to give MIUI another go. For some reason, my phone constantly vibrated in call, possibly due to an obscure proximity sensor setting. Having tried a number of ways to switch it off, I finally gave up and decided it was time to try something different. My SO got an iPhone 4s and I was very close to getting one for myself.</description>

      <description>Android 2.3 (Gingerbread) claims to support SIP natively. For some weird reason it does not play well with SmartVOIP, probably due to missing STUN server support. SmartVOIP provide a native android app called MobileVOIP but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t integrate with the Android UI. I found this nifty little app called CSipSimpleÂ which has loads of configuration options (e.g. connect when on WiFi and or 3G etc). It integrates really well with the native CyanogenMod UI and seems to be working really well in my limited tests.</description>
