      <description>In what feels like an annual tradition, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to try and write a blog post before the year runs out. Too late! This year has been overwhelming in more ways than I can count. With everything rushing by, I&amp;rsquo;ve not really had a moment to think and process all that&amp;rsquo;s happening around me. But I&amp;rsquo;m also grateful for all the amazing things that happened to me in 2020 and it feels like I should at least list them out.</description>
