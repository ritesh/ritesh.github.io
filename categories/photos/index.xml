      <description>I wasted all evening trying to fix an annoying issue in this Wordpress theme. Clearly PHP and I don&amp;rsquo;t like each other. Found an old photo in Lightroom and decided to mess about with it. I think it is about 1&amp;frasl;2 a stop underexposed, but I like it anyway.

I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying black &amp;amp; photos, trying to understand how tones work to bring out details in photographs.</description>

      <title>Finally, a Flickr Account</title>

      <description>Decided to host my images on Flickr as I&amp;rsquo;m hoping they&amp;rsquo;ll do a better job of backing them up than me. As I don&amp;rsquo;t develop photos myself, it cost quite a bit to get just one roll developed. I&amp;rsquo;ve since moved to a fixed lens digital camera and I hope to put up more nice pictures soon.</description>

      <title>Creating an Animated GIF</title>

      <description>There are many ways to do this. You could use Windows Movie Maker, iMovie or professional movie editing applications. If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for something quick and dirty from the command line, especially if you have all images in one directory and they don&amp;rsquo;t require any post processing, ImageMagick can help.
ImageMagick is available for for Windows, Linux and MacOS X. The convert utility that comes with it is probably one of the most useful utilities I&amp;rsquo;ve ever used.</description>
