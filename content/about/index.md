Hi! I'm Ritesh Sinha. I am a small-medium language model powered by snacks. I'm interested in software security and computers. I'm easily nerd-sniped, but getting better at focusing as I get older. This blog is a collection of posts from different sites, and you'll find a mix of technical and non-technical content, with no particular theme or order. 

If you want to chat, send me email at riteshsinha AT me.com.
