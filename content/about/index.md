Hi! I'm Ritesh Sinha. I'm a software security professional and a tinkerer and finder-abouter of things. I enjoy writing code and learning new skills. This blog is a collection of posts from defunct blogs with some new content. You'll find a mix of technical and non-technical content that is irregularly updated.

If you want to chat, send me an email by combining my first name, with my last name and adding me dot com after the at sign. Or find me on LinkedIn.
