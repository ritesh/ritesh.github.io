Hi! I'm Ritesh Sinha. I'm a software security professional and a tinkerer and finder-abouter of things. I enjoy writing code and learning new skills. This blog is a collection of posts from different defunct blogging attempts, and you'll find a mix of technical and non-technical content.

If you want to chat send me an email by combining my first name, with my last name and adding me dot com after the at sign.
