I go through a lot of experiments and ideas. I have a terrible memory for things. This is a list that I can use to remind myself of the things I was looking at and have either forgotten or lost interest in. 

## Learning a LISP language
I've often heard about how [LISP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_\(programming_language'\)) was the greatest thing since sliced bread. Expressivity, consciseness, power. The thing that you're told about LISP is that once you "get" it, it blows your mind. I have not yet experienced this epiphany. 

So far, the things that bothers me most are the incessant `(((((((parens)))))))` and the lack of static types. 

I'll have a go at Haskell/OCaml someday. 

I have messed around with
   * Common LISP
   * Emacs LISP
   * Chez Scheme
   * Racket and friends
   
My adventures in LISP have been random and limited to trivial examples. I have not yet tried to write anything challenging using any LISP dialect.

I'm trying to use [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) more as an alternative to VSCode and similar editors. I don't have the skills or the time to configure stuff so I use a [set of opinionated defaults](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs). I have bad memories of the times I've created technical debt in the form of massive and complex `vimrc` configurations. 

Now I let someone else choose what's best.

### TODOs 
   - [ ] implement a Mandelbrot fractal viewer
   - [ ] write a web application in a LISP dialect

## Learning to sketch and paint

For most of my life I've been focused on computers and computer related yak-shaving. As I get older, I'm always looking for activities that don't involve a computer. Sketching is a "low entry barrier" kind of activity, but the few times I've tried to sketch stuff - it has been terrible. I would like to believe that you can get reasonably good with practice, even if you don't have innate artistic talent. This is my aim. 

Doodling and painting are fun activities that I can enjoy with my children. 

Looking back a few years, I detested anything that wasn't computer/tech related. The older I get, the more I think of technology as a necessity that has overwhelmed everything else. 

### TODOs 
   - [ ] Practice more 
   - [ ] Find a good course or books to learn the technical theory 
   related to sketching 
   - [ ] Learn more colour theory
   - [ ] Try to do an oil painting tutorial


## 3D printing 

I imagine everyone that buys a 3D printer without a plan ends up in the same situation that I'm in. After a few weeks of constant printing and boundless enthusiasm - I'm out of ideas. 

What can I print that is not a poor copy of a thing that I can buy? I get the utility of being able to print things like door stoppers and such. What I would like to do is print something more novel. 

So far the only idea I have is to try to build a pinhole camera that gives you passable photos of landscapes. I've seen some designs online but need to do more research. 


## Learning Mandarin in Duolingo

Been surprisingly consistent with this one. As of today (23 Sept 2025), I've clocked 250+ days of continuously opening the Duolingo app to learn Mandarin. I can't say I'm anywhere close to speaking it, but I can recognise some characters. Still struggle with reading Chinese characters, it's a very challenging language.

I think Duolingo's great, but like any language learner will tell you - you probably need to do more immersive style training to develop even a modicum of proficiency. 

### TODOs
   - [ ] Continue Duolingo for 1+ year
   - [ ] Finish a proper Mandarin speaking/writing course on Udemy

## Running consistently

On and off, I'm trying to run consistently. This has been good for my mental health and helps me sleep better. In 2023-2024, I was enthusiastic about signing up for races and training for them. This year, not so much. 

The goal is to be consistent and slowly cover longer distances. And not focus on speed. Which is difficult for my ego but better for my body. 

### TODOs 
   - [ ] Run 15k
   - [ ] Run 21.1k 
   - [ ] Run 30k
   
## Reading books consistently 
I used to be a voracious reader. Now I'm glued to screens looking for novelty. It's a hard mindset to change, but I'm hoping to chip away at it. Have read a few books this year and hope to read more. 

A short story that I enjoyed a lot was Kafka's The Trial. It is a bizarre story, reads like a cross between a fever dream and impressionist version of a "regular" short story. I don't like stories with predictable plot points or simplistic good/evil tropes. 

## Video games
Currently trying
   - Hollow Knight: the first version, not SilkSong
   - Celeste: it's hard to do the stunt jumps, really hard!
   - Balatro+: super fun card game!
   - Divinity 2: IDK if I'll ever learn this game, I'm too casual
   - Pillar of Eternity: Same as above
   
Enjoyed and completed
   - Slay the Spire: Very fun card game
   - Steamworld Dig 2: Another "metroidvania" style game 
   

## Discovering old arty-farty films

Recently had an obsession with trying to find old Hindi or Indian films that
didn't make it to the mainstream but were really good. I'll add a list of what I've discovered soon. 

So far, I know _of_ the Apu Trilogy (Satyajit Ray) but haven't watched them. 

## Formal verification of code/Symbolic execution

Still don't fully understand how symbolic execution can be used to *prove* aspects related to code. I have a high level understanding but need to try it to know wtf goes on.
