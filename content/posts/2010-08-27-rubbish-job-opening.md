Received an email today about a job opening at a major CMM level   
something company. Required skill : VMWare. Experience required 2 - 15   
years. VMWare was founded in 1998, that gives us 12 years since it's   
been around. How does one have 15 years of experience with something   
that wasn't around until 12 years ago? Who writes these job   
descriptions?
