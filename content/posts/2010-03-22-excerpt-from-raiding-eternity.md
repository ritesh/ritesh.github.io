> Chances are we'll each be lost to time. 100 billion people have been   
born before us. Most of them no longer exist as individuals in our   
memories. No names. Faces only reflected in our own and not in any way   
that really matters. 

> But not us. We might be remembered forever. All our Twitter   
updates, our email, our Vimeo movies, our Xbox Live profiles, our   
wormy FourSquare maps. They won't be important. Not to most people,   
anyway. But they'll be there if the sysadmins take care of us, if the   
corporations and machines to whom we've entrusted our records do not   
fail or are not destroyed. 

> We won't matter to most. But our memories will be cataloged,   
indexed, made available along with our stories, our names.
