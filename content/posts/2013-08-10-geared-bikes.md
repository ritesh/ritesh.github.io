Got a sweet road bike off Gumtree. I thought the gears weren't working, having never ridden a geared bike before.


Me: "The gears on this bike don't work"

Bike shop guy: "Have you tried shifting these levers right here?"

Me: "Those are brakes, right?"

Bike shop guy: "How have you been shifting gears until this point?"

Me: "I'll show myself out, thanks"


_Laughter in the background as I walk out of the bike shop._

Never making fun of my computer illiterate friends and family ever again.
