I have this weird hobby of amassing USB sticks/pen drives. My latest acquisition is a Corsair Voyager Mini 4G. I'd heard great things about the Corsair Voyager so I decided to pick one up. The voyager mini is really tiny and packs 4GB of storage.

My experience with it was quite unfortunate though, as I had to get the drive replaced twice (my work system refuses to copy large files to it). I just got the latest replacement today, seems to be working fine. Here are the HDTach scores if you care. I was quite impressed with the burst speed of 28.4MB/s. Plan to install and run the latest Fedora 10 preview. Let's see how it goes.  

**Update**: The USB stick works perfectly. Turns out the issue was that the USB ports at work are faulty (possibly misconfigured in the BIOS). So it didn't need replacement after all. Woot.
