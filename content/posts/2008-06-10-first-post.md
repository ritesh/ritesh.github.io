Ok, I lied. This is a remake of the old blog by the same name. Deleted all the old posts which I thought were meaningless drivel. Incidentally, [Drivel](http://www.dropline.net/drivel/) seems to be a good desktop blogging client. Available through your nearest apt repository. 

Was following news of the [Apple WWDC](http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/) quite closely even though I don't own any working apple products. The only apple product I have is a 5 year old broken iPod. The set prices seems quite reasonable. $199 for the 8G version and $299 for the 16G one. I'm pretty sure there are some hidden costs, though. Engadget, Gizmodo and LifeHacker have plenty of coverage of the event.

I've just realized how hard it is to write. With every passing sentence I feel a grammatical, logical or spelling error coming on. Hats off to people who churn out pages after pages of blogs everyday.
