Android 2.3 (Gingerbread) claims to support SIP natively. For some weird reason it does not play well with SmartVOIP, probably due to missing STUN server support. SmartVOIP provide a native android app called MobileVOIP but it doesn't integrate with the Android UI. I found this nifty little app called [CSipSimple](http://code.google.com/p/csipsimple/)Â which has loads of configuration options (e.g. connect when on WiFi and or 3G etc). It integrates really well with the native CyanogenMod UI and seems to be working really well in my limited tests. It's available on the android market by the same name. I finally decided to get rid of Skype from my phone as it tends to use a lot of memory and isn't particularly cheap when calling other phones.
