I'm a big fan of Python, especially its syntax which feels close to natural language. My programming skills are average, as I've never done any serious full time development, apart from some code I wrote for my MSc project. The project was mostly built using [scrapy](http://scrapy.org/) with little hacks thrown in to implement concurrency for processing data. Nowadays, I tend to use Python mostly as a glue language to automate stuff when bash doesn't cut it. Stuff like this makes me like it even more:

    
    
    # python -m SimpleHTTPServer
    


It's a basic but mostly functional HTTP server. If an index.html file is found it is served; if not, you get a directory listing instead.
