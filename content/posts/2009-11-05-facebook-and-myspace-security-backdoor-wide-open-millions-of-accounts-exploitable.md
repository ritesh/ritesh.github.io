> As a application developer on Facebook, I usually run into certain walls that limit my application functionality. But I don't give up easily, and only recently I found a solution to one of my function limitations. Suprisingly, when looked into more carefully my solution  allowed full access and control to the Facebook user account that accessed my application. Did I mention this would also be untraceable since exploit actions would happen from the users IP and own domain cookie?</blockquote>

Apparently this is an issue with crossdomain permissions. Should be fixed soon. You  might have already been compromised!
