I wasted all evening trying to fix an annoying issue in this Wordpress theme. Clearly PHP and I don't like each other.
Found an old photo in Lightroom and decided to mess about with it. I think it is about 1/2 a stop underexposed, but I like it anyway.

I'm enjoying black & photos, trying to understand how tones work to bring out details in photographs.
