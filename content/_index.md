# Hello!

I'm Ritesh Sinha. I'm a software security professional and a tinkerer and finder-abouter of things. I enjoy writing code and learning new skills. This blog is a [collection of posts](/posts/) from defunct blogs with some new content. You'll find a mix of technical and non-technical content that is sometimes updated.

If you want to chat, [send me an email](mailto:blogrsinha@icloud.com). Or find me on [LinkedIn](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/riteshks).
