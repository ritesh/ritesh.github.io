      <description>Trying to build a Qt project on Linux today. Turns out, (some) Qt programmers are case insensitive when it comes to including heAdEr fiLEs in C++ source. This is fine on Windows and macOS, but on an OS with a case sensitive filesystem like ext4, this causes a whole lot of problems. gcc and g++ try and fail to find coolHeader.h if it&amp;rsquo;s called CoolHeader.h. I&amp;rsquo;m sure that this isn&amp;rsquo;t an uncommon problem, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find a solution that didn&amp;rsquo;t involve serious sed-fu.</description>

      <description>There are many ways to do this. You could use Windows Movie Maker, iMovie or professional movie editing applications. If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for something quick and dirty from the command line, especially if you have all images in one directory and they don&amp;rsquo;t require any post processing, ImageMagick can help.
ImageMagick is available for for Windows, Linux and MacOS X. The convert utility that comes with it is probably one of the most useful utilities I&amp;rsquo;ve ever used.</description>

      <description>Android 2.3 (Gingerbread) claims to support SIP natively. For some weird reason it does not play well with SmartVOIP, probably due to missing STUN server support. SmartVOIP provide a native android app called MobileVOIP but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t integrate with the Android UI. I found this nifty little app called CSipSimple which has loads of configuration options (e.g. connect when on WiFi and or 3G etc). It integrates really well with the native CyanogenMod UI and seems to be working really well in my limited tests.</description>

      <description>BANGALORE, India—Call-center company 24/7 Customer Pvt. Ltd. is desperate to find new recruits who can answer questions by phone and email. It wants to hire 3,000 people this year. Yet in this country of 1.2 billion people, that is beginning to look like an impossible goal.
  So few of the high school and college graduates who come through the door can communicate effectively in English, and so many lack a grasp of educational basics such as reading comprehension, that the company can hire just three out of every 100 applicants.</description>

years. VMWare was founded in 1998, that gives us 12 years since it&amp;rsquo;s

      <description>Living in an area with very frequent powercuts, I&amp;rsquo;m often annoyed by the constant beeping of the UPS at odd hours. I have a system that is constantly on and is connected to a very basic UPS that provides no power management features at all (via USB or serial). In Bangalore, you don&amp;rsquo;t really need a constant buzzing sound to remind you that the power is out, the unbearable heat is enough to get you up and about.</description>

      <description>On a tech forum I visit often, we were discussing the various ways to
power down a computer when power goes out (apart from the boring way
of making your UPS automatically doing it for you). Now that I think
about it, I&amp;rsquo;m really obsessed with shutting computers down. I had an
idea long ago which was quite stupid but I&amp;rsquo;m gonna note it down anyway
so that I can laugh about it later.</description>

      <description>Chances are we&amp;rsquo;ll each be lost to time. 100 billion people have been
born before us. Most of them no longer exist as individuals in our
memories. No names. Faces only reflected in our own and not in any way
that really matters.
  But not us. We might be remembered forever. All our Twitter
updates, our email, our Vimeo movies, our Xbox Live profiles, our
wormy FourSquare maps.</description>

      <description>Backtrack 4 was released today. I had just completed downloading the
beta version only yesterday and finished installing it today. Since
BT4 has now moved to Ubuntu, I&amp;rsquo;d assumed that upgrading it to the
final would be easy as apt-get pie. I did and pretty much hosed KDE. A
little research showed that KDE is now in a different path (/opt/kde3)
than it was before (/usr/kde3).
The quickest hack to fix this is to add /usr/kde3 to the PATH line in</description>

      <description>Patrick Stewart got used to being called ’sir’ playing Captain Jean Luc Picard during seven seasons of Star Trek The Next Generation and four feature films. But now it appears he will be being called ’sir’ in real life as news out of the UK reports the actor will be knighted by the Queen.

      <description>You are in a game show with nineteen other players. You don&amp;rsquo;t know the other players, you can&amp;rsquo;t see them, and you can&amp;rsquo;t communicate with them. The game you are in is called &amp;lsquo;Greed!&amp;rsquo;, and is straightforward to explain. You are asked to write down a whole dollar amount in the range $1 - $1,000,000 on a piece of paper. You will be paid the amount you asked for if it is deemed to be &amp;lsquo;non-greedy&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>Google&amp;rsquo;s Wave tool suffers from a &amp;ldquo;just another inbox&amp;rdquo; problem. So it&amp;rsquo;s great to see Wave running inside a tab in Thunderbird, right next to your email inbox, with a single JavaScript line.
  Among Thunderbird 3&amp;rsquo;s new features is Content Tabs, a way to monitor other web sites and web-based messaging from inside Thunderbird. The Quetzalcoatal blog hacked together a little code that opens Wave cleanly and conveniently inside one of these tabs, and even keeps it open after you restart Thunderbird.</description>

find very useful are:
  fring (free): Works with gtalk, twitter, fb, msn etc. If you have
one of those newfangled Nseries phones, you can use the front camera
to make skype video calls (over WiFi).
  Nokia Messaging Email (free beta, might change in the future): The
native email application on the E71 is a load of crap.</description>

      <description>India plans to set up a centralized system to monitor communications on mobile phones, landlines and the Internet in the country, a minister told the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of Parliament, on Thursday.
  Indian laws allow the interception and monitoring of communications under certain conditions, including to counter terrorism.
  A pilot of the new Centralized Monitoring System (CMS) is to be started by June next year, subject to clearances by other government agencies, Gurudas Kamat, Minister of State for Communications and Information Technology told the Rajya Sabha, according to an announcement by the government&amp;rsquo;s Press Information Bureau.</description>

      <description>As a application developer on Facebook, I usually run into certain walls that limit my application functionality. But I don&amp;rsquo;t give up easily, and only recently I found a solution to one of my function limitations. Suprisingly, when looked into more carefully my solution allowed full access and control to the Facebook user account that accessed my application. Did I mention this would also be untraceable since exploit actions would happen from the users IP and own domain cookie?</description>

      <description>In 2007, Abdelmalek Bayout admitted to stabbing and killing a man and received a sentenced of 9 years and 2 months. Last week, _Nature _ reported that Pier Valerio Reinotti, an appeal court judge in Trieste, Italy, cut Bayout&amp;rsquo;s sentence by a year after finding out he has gene variants linked to aggression. Leaving aside the question of whether this link is well enough understood to justify Reinotti&amp;rsquo;s decision, should genes ever be considered a legitimate defence?</description>

      <description>IS GEORGE W. BUSH stupid? It&amp;rsquo;s a question that occupied a good many minds of all political persuasions during his turbulent eight-year presidency. The strict answer is no. Bush&amp;rsquo;s IQ score is estimated to be above 120, which suggests an intelligence in the top 10 per cent of the population. But this, surely, does not tell the whole story. Even those sympathetic to the former president have acknowledged that as a thinker and decision-maker he is not all there.</description>

      <description>Prior to using any Debian derivatives, I was a RedHat fan and hence
heavily favoured Fedora/CentOS/RHEL over other distributions. Over the
last few releases Fedora has been a disappointment and I was stuck
between using Gentoo/Ubuntu. Hell I even gave FreeBSD a shot (sucked
for me). Gentoo was my favoured distribution about 2-3 years ago but
the excessive kernel recompilation was really getting to me. To go the
more stable path I decided to give Debian a shot.</description>

After looking at several overpriced commercial solutions, we decided to build our own custom Backblaze Storage Pods: 67 terabyte 4U servers for $7,867.
  In this post, we’ll share how to make one of these storage pods, and you’re welcome to use this design.</description>

      <description>A fourth standard girl from rural Tamil Nadu has become the youngest to qualify the Microsoft certified professional examination. I think it&amp;rsquo;s high time they changed the course material for MCSE. A quick google search will show that the youngest was 10 years old (A Pakistani girl) and many more 10-15 year olds had probably had a go at it too.

On the other hand, the youngest person to crack the RHCE is 12 years old, which makes you think.</description>

I recommended that he use Openfiler. I found the rPath version  first and so I decided to check it out. I keep hearing that rPath builds very good task specific Machines, so I decided to give it a spin. rPath linux describes itself as a meta-distribution.</description>
